# OGRandomizr
A randomization website I built in 2012 to help me and my brothers decide on a movie to watch.

Currently Deployed on Vercel.

Website currently uses Vanilla JS to loop through each item within an unordered list.  In this case this is the list of movies.  It then randomly selects a movie and adds an attribute to it.  These styles bold the text. turn it red, and make it appear at the top of the page.  Very simple project, but a great start to web development at a young age.
